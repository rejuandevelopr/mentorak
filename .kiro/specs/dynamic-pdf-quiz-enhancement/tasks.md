# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance PDF text extraction for reliable content processing





  - Implement hybrid PDF processing that tries OpenAI Vision API first, then falls back to pdf-parse library
  - Add content quality validation to ensure extracted text has sufficient content (minimum 200 characters)
  - Create text preprocessing function to clean and normalize extracted content for better MCQ generation
  - Add logging to track which extraction method was used and content quality metrics
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Improve OpenAI MCQ generation to create content-specific questions





  - Enhance OpenAI prompt to emphasize generating questions from provided content only
  - Add content analysis step to identify key concepts and topics before question generation
  - Implement question validation to verify questions reference specific PDF content
  - Add retry logic with different prompts if initial generation produces generic questions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Create single-page quiz interface displaying all 10 questions





  - Redesign quiz page component to render all questions simultaneously in a scrollable layout
  - Implement question navigation system with Previous/Next buttons and direct question jumping
  - Add progress tracking that shows completion status for each question
  - Create responsive design that works well with 10 questions on various screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Add navigation controls and cancel functionality





  - Implement "Back to Dashboard" button that's always visible during quiz
  - Add cancel confirmation dialog to prevent accidental navigation
  - Ensure cancel action clears quiz state and navigates to dashboard without saving progress
  - Test navigation flow to ensure no data loss or broken states
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Implement progress indicator with theme consistency





  - Create progress bar component that shows current position out of 10 questions
  - Update progress indicator to use orange accent color matching app theme
  - Add visual indicators for completed vs. current vs. upcoming questions
  - Ensure progress updates correctly when navigating between questions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Add content validation and quality checks
  - Implement function to analyze extracted text quality and topic diversity
  - Create validation logic to ensure generated questions are content-specific
  - Add fallback prevention that only uses generic questions when absolutely necessary
  - Implement error handling for insufficient PDF content scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Test and validate dynamic question generation
  - Create test cases with different PDF types to verify unique question generation
  - Test that same PDF uploaded multiple times generates varied questions
  - Validate that questions reference specific content from uploaded documents
  - Verify error handling when PDFs have insufficient content for question generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 8. Optimize user experience and performance
  - Implement loading states during PDF processing and question generation
  - Add error messages that guide users when uploads fail
  - Optimize rendering performance for displaying 10 questions simultaneously
  - Test complete user flow from upload to quiz completion to dashboard navigation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
