# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the PDF quiz generation system to ensure questions are dynamically generated from actual PDF content, displays all 10 questions on a single page, and provides proper navigation controls. Currently, the system returns the same generic questions regardless of PDF content, and the quiz interface lacks proper navigation options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want quiz questions to be uniquely generated from my specific PDF content, so that each document produces different, relevant questions based on the actual material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload different PDF files THEN the system SHALL generate different sets of questions for each document
2. WHEN the same PDF is uploaded multiple times THEN the system SHALL generate varied questions from different sections of the content
3. WHEN a PDF contains specific topics or concepts THEN the generated questions SHALL directly reference that content
4. WHEN the PDF content is insufficient for question generation THEN the system SHALL return an error rather than generic fallback questions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all 10 quiz questions displayed on a single page, so that I can navigate through them efficiently without page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz questions are generated THEN the system SHALL display exactly 10 questions on one page
2. WHEN I answer a question THEN I SHALL be able to navigate to the next question without a page refresh
3. WHEN I want to review previous answers THEN I SHALL be able to navigate back to any previous question
4. WHEN I reach the last question THEN I SHALL see a "Finish Quiz" button instead of "Next"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to cancel the quiz and return to the dashboard at any time, so that I have control over my learning session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am taking a quiz THEN I SHALL see a "Cancel" or "Back to Dashboard" button at all times
2. WHEN I click the cancel button THEN the system SHALL navigate me back to the dashboard page
3. WHEN I cancel a quiz THEN the system SHALL not save any partial progress
4. WHEN I navigate back to dashboard THEN I SHALL see the main dashboard interface without any quiz state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the quiz interface to show my progress through all 10 questions, so that I know how many questions remain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am taking a quiz THEN I SHALL see a progress indicator showing current question number out of 10
2. WHEN I navigate between questions THEN the progress indicator SHALL update to reflect my current position
3. WHEN I complete all questions THEN the progress indicator SHALL show 100% completion
4. WHEN I view the progress indicator THEN it SHALL use the app's orange accent color theme

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OpenAI integration to use actual PDF content for question generation, so that the system produces meaningful, content-specific quizzes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF text is extracted THEN the system SHALL send the actual extracted text to OpenAI for processing
2. WHEN calling OpenAI THEN the system SHALL use a prompt that emphasizes generating questions from the provided content only
3. WHEN OpenAI generates questions THEN the system SHALL validate that questions reference specific content from the PDF
4. WHEN the PDF content is processed THEN the system SHALL always request OpenAI to generate exactly 10 multiple-choice questions from the provided content
