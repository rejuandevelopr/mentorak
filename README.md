## Deployment Notes

Originally attempted deployment via [Vercel](https://vercel.com), but encountered persistent routing/configuration issues with the custom domain **mentorak.com**. As a result, the project was moved to a custom VPS (Hostinger VPS), using:

- **Nginx** as a reverse proxy  
- **PM2** to run the Next.js server  
- **Certbot (Let's Encrypt)** for SSL
